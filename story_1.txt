Once upon a time, in a colorful village, there lived a tiny, cheerful frog. This frog had a peculiar habit of singing loudly every morning. One day, while hopping around, the frog found a shiny, mysterious key lying beside a large, old tree.
The next day, both the frog and Whiskers decided to investigate the key's origin, leading to a whimsical adventure.
