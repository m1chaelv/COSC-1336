# This exercise assumes you have created the RetailItem class for 
# Programming Exercise 5 . Create a CashRegister class that
# can be used with the RetailItem class. The CashRegister class 
# should be able to internally keep a list of RetailItem objects. 
# The class should have the following methods:
# 
# • A method named *purchase_item* that accepts a RetailItem object
#   as an argument. Each time the purchase_item method is called, 
#   the RetailItem object that is passed as an argument should be 
#   added to the list.
# • A method named *get_total* that returns the total price of all 
#   the RetailItem objects stored in the CashRegister object's 
#   internal list
# • A method named *show_items* that displays data about the 
#   RetailItem objects stored in the CashRegister object's internal 
#   list.
# • A method named *clear* that should clear the Cashregister object's 
#   internal list.
#
# Demonstrate the CashRegister class in a program that allows the 
# user to select several items for purchase. When the user is ready 
# to check out, the program should display a list of all the items 
# he or she has selected for purchase, as well as the total price.
